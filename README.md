# Dev environment requirements:

1. node.js 14.15.x (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Git 2.26.x or later (https://git-scm.com/downloads) or a compatible Git client of your preference.


# Steps to build and run the app:

1. Create a folder that will hold the project files, e.g. "react-tris".

2. Clone "**https://github.com/YiannisFy/react-tris.git**" to the project folder, e.g. with command-line git:

	**git clone https://github.com/YiannisFy/react-tris.git react-tris**

3. From a command prompt/shell, go to the project folder, e.g. "cd react-tris" and run this command to download all dependencies:
Note

	**npm install**

4. Build and run the app in your browser of preference using:

	**npm start**

This spawns a development server at http://localhost:3000 and opens a browser to the app page.
